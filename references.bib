  abstract = {The issue of “housing” has generally not been granted an important role in post-war political economy. Housing-as-policy has been the preserve of social policy analysis and of a growing field of housing studies; housing-as-market has been confined to mainstream economics. This paper insists that political-economic analysis can no longer remain relatively indifferent to the housing question since housing is implicated in the contemporary capitalist political economy in numerous critical, connected and very often contradictory ways. The paper conceptualizes this implication by identifying the multiple roles of housing when “capital” – the essential “stuff” of political economy – is considered from the perspective of each of its three primary, mutually constitutive guises: as process of circulation, as social relation and as ideology. Mobilizing these three optics to provide a critical overall picture of housing-in-political-economy (more than a political economy of housing), we draw on and weave together the many vital contributions of housing research to our evolving understanding of capitalism.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current developments in science and the media have now placed pregnant women in a precarious situation as they are charged with the responsibility to navigate through information sources to make the best decisions for her pregnancy. Yet little is known regarding how pregnant women want to receive and use health information in general, let alone information regarding the uncertain risks to pregnancy in everyday household products such as phthalates found in cosmetics and canned food liners. Using phthalates as an example, this study investigated how pregnant women obtain, evaluate, and act on information regarding their pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women were recruited using pamphlets and posters distributed in prenatal clinics, prenatal fairs and physician offices in Southwestern Ontario Canada. Research participants were engaged in 20 to 40~min semi-structured interviews regarding their use of information sources in pregnancy, particularly regarding phthalates in cosmetics and canned food liners. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using constructivist grounded theory techniques supported by NVivo 9™ software. RESULTS: Theoretical sufficiency was reached after 23 pregnant women were interviewed and their transcripts analyzed. Three overlapping themes resulted from the co-constructed analysis: I-Strength of Information Sources; II-Value Modifiers; and III-Deciding to Control Exposure. The research participants reported receiving information from a wide range of sources that they perceived varying in strength or believability. They then described the strategies employed to increase the validity of the message in order to avoid risk exposure. Pregnant women preferred a strong source of information such as physician, government but frequently used weak sources such as the internet or the opinions of friends. A model was developed from the relationship between themes that describes how pregnant women navigate the multiple sources of information available to them. CONCLUSION: Our study provides insight into how pregnant women receive, appraise, and act on information regarding everyday household chemicals. Clinicians and their professional organizations should produce specific educational materials to assist women in understanding exposure to everyday products in pregnancy.},

  abstract = {The removal of regulatory and reimbursement barriers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States presented opportunities to explore the potential of telehealth to improve access to and use of healthcare among underserved populations. Therefore, we examined factors associated with accessibility and utilisation of telehealth among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analysed the nationally representative Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement File of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65~years (n~=~5,189), administered from 5 October 2020, through 15 November 2020. Two survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the association between factors (i.e., socio-demographics, co-morbidities and digital access/literacy) and whether (1) beneficiaries' regular providers offered telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) those being offered telehealth used it. Furthermore, subgroup analyses by residing area and income status were conducted. Of study beneficiaries, 83.6\% reported their regular providers offered telehealth during COVID-19. Disparities in accessibility of telehealth by sociodemographic status were observed [e.g., those living in a non-metro area (versus metro) were 7.1\% (marginal effect [ME]~=~-7.1\%; p~{$<~$}0.01) less likely to report accessibility of telehealth]. Beneficiaries who had no access to internet (ME~=~-8.2\%; p~{$<~$}0.001) and had not participated in video/voice calls/conferencing prior (versus participated) (ME~=~-6.6\%; p~{$<~$}0.001) were less likely to report having access to telehealth. Among those being offered telehealth services, 43.0\% reported using telehealth services. Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black beneficiaries (e.g., Black versus White; ME~=~11.3\%; p~{$<~$}0.01) and those with co-morbidities (versus 0-1 condition) (e.g., 2-3 co-morbidities, ME~=~7.3\%; p~{$<~$}0.01) were more likely to report using telehealth services when offered. Similar results were observed in the subgroup analyses regarding disparities in accessibility and utilisation of telehealth. The accessibility and utilisation of telehealth have increased amidst the pandemic; however, disparities in accessibility of telehealth were observed. A telehealth triage protocol is needed to ensure underserved patients continue to receive appropriate care.},
