# Aims

This file loads the main HIPE data, and the HIPE data for the study hospital, a Model 4 hospital, the chart review data for the study hospital, and a file of the ACHI procedure codes used nationally in that year. It processes these data, and prepares the analysis datasets.

# Load and process the national HIPE, ACHI, site HIPE, and Chart Review data files

First we load the data.

```{r Load main data files, results = 'hide'}
########### Main HIPE file #####################
HIPE <- as_tibble(read.csv("data/H240272_2022.csv",
        strip.white = TRUE, na.strings = c("", NA)))

########### StudyID ##################################
#There is a StudyID variable at the start of the HIPE site file, so we add a blank StudyID to the start of this HIPE file
#
HIPE <- HIPE %>%
  mutate(StudyID = paste0(row_number())) %>%
  relocate(StudyID)

########### HIPE.Site #################################
# HIPE linked to chart review file

# These never had a chart review.
# 
HIPE.Site <- HIPE.Site %>%
  filter(StudyID != 41 & StudyID != 405)

########## Make StudyID character ###################
# Make StudyID a character variable
# 
HIPE.Site <- HIPE.Site %>%

```

## Process the HIPE and coding data

We now have the four original data files loaded, and minimally tidied.
We now do a *lot* more preparation on the national and site HIPE data files.

### HIPE processing

We write a function that

* Names the variables consistently
* Generates a number of new variables
    + ID, a unique identifier variable
    + DateOfAdmission, DateOfDischarge, MonthOfAdmission, MonthOfDischarge
    + SeasonOfAdmission (Nov-Feb = Winter) (Mar-Oct = Other)
    + MedSurg, based on recorded specialty on admission
    + ModelF, a factor for Hospital Model
    + HospNo and HospCode
    + Source - four levels each, Home, Care, Transfer, Other
    + Destination - four levels each, Home, Care, Transfer, Dead, Other
    + Died - Dead or Alive
    + Charlson and Elixhauser scores and components
    + ProcCount, HadxCount, and DxCount - counts of non-missing codes
    + AgeC and LosC - centred and scaled Age (age) and Length of stay (rawlos)

### Apply key funtion to HIPE data

There are two HIPE data files.

* HIPE.Site contains HIPE data matched to the specific records reviewed as part of the chart review.
* HIPE contains the national HIPE data for the same population.

Note that the HIPE file *includes* the whole HIPE.Site data, but they are not matched, nor linked by any common identifier.

```{r Process both files HIPE and HIPE.Site}

HIPE <- HIPE_PROCESS(HIPE)
HIPE.Site <- HIPE_PROCESS(HIPE.Site)

```

## DRG

DRG codes are alphanumeric codes, which have a description attached. most of these descriptions, include an indication of complexity, either Minor, Intermediate or Major.

### DRG codes

```{r DRG descriptions without Complexity clearly marked}
DRG_used <- HIPE |>
  select(drgv.8,drg.desc) |>
  group_by(drgv.8, drg.desc) |>
  summarise(N = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(N))

DRG_noComplexity <- DRG_used |>
  filter(!grepl('omplexity',drg.desc)) |>
  group_by(drgv.8, drg.desc) |>
  summarise(N = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(N))

DRG_noComplexity_at_all <- DRG_used |>
  filter(!grepl('omp',drg.desc)) |>
  group_by(drgv.8, drg.desc) |>
  summarise(N = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(N))
```

In some `r length(DRG_noComplexity$N)` out of `r length(DRG_used$N)`, the complexity description is abbreviated to Comp, or to Inter comp, Min Comp, or it is missing altogether.

```{r Cleanup Nocomplexity}
rm(DRG_noComplexity_at_all, DRG_noComplexity, DRG_used)
```

Looking at the history of the DRG codes [1. Dimitropoulos V, Yeend T, Zhou Q, McAlister S, Navakatikyan M, Hoyle P, et al. A new clinical complexity model for the Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups. Health Policy. 2019 Nov 1;123(11):1049–52.], of those in this study, five clearly are (at least) intermediate complexity DRG's, requiring transfer within 5 days, which ought to be reflected in our analysis.

Note that these are not given complexity codes in the DRG system, because the purpose of that system was to predict costs. It is also worth noting that patients who were rapidly transferred will mostly be in the study as transfers from another facility, and will have little opportunity to have our outcomes recorded in the originating hospital. These codes were -

* Intermediate
  + B70D (39) Stroke and Other Cerebrovascular Disorders, Transferred to Acute Facility <5 Days
  + B78C (7) Intracranial Injuries, Transferred to Acute Facility <5 Days
  + F60B (72) Circulatory Disorders, Admitted for Acute Myocardial Infarction without Invasive Cardiac Investigative Procedures, Transferred to Acute Facility <5 Days
  + F62C (20) Heart Failure and Shock, Transferred to Acute Facility <5Days
  + Y60Z (3) Burns, Transferred to Acute Facility <5 Days

In addition, a number of codes represent significantly complex conditions, and, for our purposes, ought to be further coded for complexity. These include

* Intermediate
  + T40Z (9) Infectious and parasitic diseases with ventilator support
* High
  + A01Z (4) Liver transplant
  + A03Z (4) Heart and/or lung transplant
  + W03Z (2) Abdominal Procedures for Multiple Significant Trauma
  + Y01Z (2) Vent >=96hrs or Trach for Burns or OR Procs for Severe Full Thickness Burns

### DRG processing

We prepare a coding file to put DRG's into levels of complexity, as discussed below.

```{r code DRGs as complexity}
#
## Generate a tibble with two columns - DRG code and complexity
#
DRG <- HIPE |>
  select(drgv.8, drg.desc) |>
  group_by(drgv.8, drg.desc) |>
  summarise(N = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(N))

DRG <- DRG |>
  mutate(Complexity = ifelse(
    str_detect(stringi::stri_extract_last_words(drg.desc), pattern = 'omp'),
    word(drg.desc, -2),'NOCOMP')) %>%
  # Take the second last word in the description,
  # but only if the last word matches 'omp'. This is beacuse Complexity
  # ia abbreviated as Comp in these data
  mutate(Complexity = case_match(Complexity,
                                 c("Min", "Minor") ~ "Minor",
                                 c("Interm", "Intermediate") ~ "Intermediate",
                                 c("Maj", "Major") ~ "Major",
                                 c("NOCOMP") ~ "NOCOMP"
                                 )) %>%
  # Recode complexity to map the abbreviations Min, Maj and Interm to the
  # respective full values, and flag descriptions where
  # no specific complexity given as NOCOMP
  mutate(CC = case_match(drgv.8,
                        c('B70D','B78C','F60B','F62C','Y60Z') ~ 'Intermediate',
                        c('T40Z') ~ 'Intermediate',
                        c('A01Z','A03Z','W03Z','Y01Z') ~ 'Major',
                        .default = 'NOCOMP'
                        )) %>%
  # Recode the specific identified DRG codes discussed in the text correctly
  mutate(Complexity = ifelse(Complexity == 'NOCOMP', CC, Complexity)) %>%
  mutate(Complexity = ifelse(Complexity == 'NOCOMP', 'Minor', Complexity)) %>%
  # Add these specific codes to the main list
  # and set all others to Minor in two stages
  mutate(Complexity = as_factor(Complexity)) %>%
  mutate(Complexity = fct_relevel(Complexity, "Minor", "Intermediate", "Major"))
  # Make Complexity a factor in the correct order

DRG_coding <- DRG %>%
  # Lose the extra variables from DRG
  select(drgv.8, Complexity)

DRG <- DRG |> group_by(Complexity) |> summarise(Count = sum(N))

```

We use this file to add the DRG Complexity codes to the file

```{r AddDRG complexity codes to the files}

HIPE <- HIPE |>
  left_join(DRG_coding, by = join_by(drgv.8 == drgv.8)) |>
  select(StudyID:HadxCount, Complexity, hosp.anon:proc.desc.20)

HIPE.Site <- HIPE.Site |>
  left_join(DRG_coding, by = join_by(drgv.8 == drgv.8)) |>
  select(StudyID:HadxCount, Complexity, hosp.anon:proc.desc.20)

```

### Level of complexity

Most admissions nationally have higher complexity.

```{r Table of complexity}

kable(DRG)

```

## ACHI Procedures codes

For the diagnoses, there are two sets of summary codes already provided. These are DRG codes and MDC codes, which provide, respectively, a longer and shorter summary of the diagnosis assigned. For procedures no simple classification is accessible. Each person has up to 30 codes, and the only guide is the the first procedure is that associated with the reason for admission. After that, many of the procedure codes are blank, as most people have less than 3 procedure codes.

### Intent of processing procedure codes

We have two goals - 

* Identify people who had anaesthetics, often used as a proxy for surgical cases.
* Reduce the number of procedure codes to a manageable number for further analysis.

To do this we have access to the following for each of the procedures used in the data -

* proc - One of 2,469 numeric procedure codes
* proc_desc - A description of what each code covers
* Block -  One of 942 numeric codes for an aggregate of related procedure codes
* block_desc - A description of each block
* Proc_Type - One of 81 general descriptions of the type of procedure
* Anatomical_Site - One of 119 body sites where that procedure was done
* Chapter_n - One of 19 codes for the ACHI chapter into which that procedure falls
* Chapter - A description of each chapter

```{r skim ACHI}
skim(ACHI %>%
       mutate( across( where(is.numeric) , as.character)))
        # Make all variables characters temporarily
```

### Add ACHI codes to the main dataset.

First, prepare files with one row per procedure per discharge (20 rows per discharge record).

Then compare the list of ACHI codes provided to that in the full HIPE, and the chart review site HIPE data.

All codes go from 0 - no procedure in that category, up to the total number of procedures received in that category

There are 19 chapters, most of which make sense, but one, Chapter 19, 'Interventions Not Elsewhere Classified' needs to be divided further. In any event each chapter needs to become a variable. Chapter 19 can be divided sensibly further into the anatomical site recorded, as these are things like Diagnostic test, and Allied Health Professional.

### ACHI processing

We prepare a coding file to group ACHI procedures into meaningful group, mostly by ACHI chapter, for Intervention n.e.c. we use the Anatomical sites provided.

```{r Prepare per procedure files PROC and PROC_SITE}
# These have 20 rows per StudyId, one of each of the 20 procedure codes.

PROC <- HIPE |>
  select(StudyID,proc.01:proc.20) |>
  pivot_longer(cols=!StudyID,
               names_to = 'Procedure',
               values_to = 'ACHI_code') |>
  full_join(ACHI, by = join_by(ACHI_code == proc))


PROC.Site <- HIPE.Site |>
  select(StudyID, proc.01:proc.20) |>
  pivot_longer(cols=!StudyID,
               names_to = 'Procedure',
               values_to = 'ACHI_code') |>
  full_join(ACHI, by = join_by(ACHI_code == proc)) |>
  filter(!is.na(StudyID)) # Remove unused codes

```

Check the codes used

```{r compare list of ACHI codes provided to that in the full HIPE (not the chart review site HIPE.site) file}

    PROC_unused <- PROC |> filter(is.na(StudyID)) |> select(ACHI_code) |>
      group_by(ACHI_code) |> unique() |>
      arrange(ACHI_code) # 0 codes not used

    PROC_used <- PROC |> filter(!is.na(StudyID)) |> select(ACHI_code) |>
      group_by(ACHI_code) |> unique() |>
      arrange(ACHI_code) # 2470 codes used
# Total codes is 2470 - the original 2469 and the missing code

   PROC_unused.Site <- PROC.Site |> filter(is.na(StudyID)) |> select(ACHI_code) |>
      group_by(ACHI_code) |> unique() |>
      arrange(ACHI_code) # 1995 codes not used

    PROC_used.Site <- PROC.Site |> filter(!is.na(StudyID)) |> select(ACHI_code) |>
      group_by(ACHI_code) |> unique() |>
      arrange(ACHI_code) # 475 codes used
# Total codes is 2470 - the original 2469 and the missing code

rm(PROC_unused, PROC_unused.Site, PROC_used, PROC_used.Site)
```

## Merge the HIPE.Site data and the chart review data

Next we check and merge the Chart Review data, and the corresponding HIPE.Site data for those cases.

```{r Check and merge two sets of site data}

```

## Failure to maintain

This is a variable indicating the presence of one, or , more, of PN (Pneumonia), UTI (Urinary tract infection), PU (Pressure ulcer), or DL (Delirium) associated with health care identified in the chart review.

This adds one new variable to the combined Hipe.Site and Chart Review file

* F2M Failure to maintain

```{r Failure to Maintain F2M}  
############# F2M ############################
# F2M Failure to maintain - any one or more of the adverse outcomes
# PN (Pneumonia), UTI (Urinary tract infection), PU (Pressure ulcer), or DL (Delirium)

Cost2Care.HIPE <- Cost2Care.HIPE |>
    mutate(F2M = ifelse(
        (UTI == "Yes" | PN == "Yes" | PU == "Yes" | DL == "Yes")
        ,"Yes", "No")
    )

```

## Summary report

```{r Calculate some useful numbers}
# some relevant figures
  PEOPLE <- nrow(HIPE)
  HOSPITALS <- length(unique(HIPE$hosp.anon))
  STUDY <- nrow(HIPE.Site)

```

There are a total of `r PEOPLE` admissions in these records, from `r HOSPITALS` different hospitals. Of these `r STUDY` from one Model 4 hospital took part in the chart review study.

```{r Delete the numbers}
rm(PEOPLE, HOSPITALS, STUDY)
```

# Outcomes

## Counts of admissions

How many discharges are included in these data? There are five types of hospital included, of very varying sizes. A simple table shows substantial variability in these.

```{r discharges table by site}
table(HIPE$ModelF)[[3]]

ctable(x = HIPE$HospCode,
       y = HIPE$ModelF,
       prop ='n')
```


```{r Discharges by hospital and hospital type, fig.cap= 'Discharges by hospital model and site.', fig.dpi=1200, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
Discharge <- HIPE %>%
  select(ModelF, HospCode) %>%
  group_by(ModelF, HospCode) %>%
  summarise(N = n())

ggplot(data=Discharge,
       aes(x=HospCode, y = N, colour = ModelF, fill = ModelF)) +
           geom_col(colour = 'black') +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90)) +
    facet_wrap(~ModelF, scales = 'free_x') +
           labs( title = 'Number of discharges by hospital model and site)',
                 subtitle = 'HIPE data, aged 65 years or over, 3 or more days stay, acute hospitals only',
                 x = 'Hospital code',
                 y = 'Number of discharges') +
  guides(colour = "none", fill = "none", size = "none") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 12)

rm(Discharge)
```

## Timing of admissions

Although some of the admissions were a very long time before discharge, most occurred during late 2021 and  2022, as Figure 1 shows.

```{r Admission dates by time, fig.cap= 'Admission dates by month and year for discharges included in the analysis.', fig.dpi=600, fig.height=4, fig.width=6}
Admissions <- HIPE %>%
    group_by(DateOfAdmission) %>%
    summarise(N = n())

ggplot(data=Admissions,
       aes(x=DateOfAdmission, y= N)) +
           geom_point(colour = 'red',
                      size = 3) +
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = '6 months',
                 date_labels = '%b_%y') +
           labs( title = 'Admissions per month in data set',
                 subtitle = 'HIPE data, aged 65 years or over, 3 or more days stay, acute hospitals only',
                 x = 'Date of admission',
                 y = 'Count') +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 12)
       
rm(Admissions)
```

## Comorbidity scores

It can be useful to consider comorbidity scores, and two of the most popular of these are the Elixhauser  and Charlson  scores. These are calculated using in this work using the comorbidity package , in turn based on.

The figure shows the joint and separate distributions of these scores amongst the discharges.  The very limited range of Charlson scores encountered, is contrasted with the much wider range of the Elixhauser scores.

```{r Plot of E & C scores, fig.cap= 'Plot of Elixhauser and Charlson weighted scores for the discharges included in the analysis.', fig.dpi=1200, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
ggplot(data=HIPE,
       aes(x = ScoreCh, y = ScoreEl,
           fill = ModelCode, colour = ModelCode)) +
  geom_tile() +
  facet_wrap(~ModelCode) +
           labs( title = 'Plot of Elixhauser and Charlson weighted scores',
                 subtitle = 'HIPE data, aged 65 years or over, 3 or more days stay, acute hospitals only',
                 x = 'Charlson Score',
                 y = 'Elixhauser Score') +
  guides(colour = guide_legend("Hospital\nModel"),
         fill = guide_legend("Hospital\nModel")) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 12)
```

## Length of stay

Lengths of stay varied greatly also, as Figure 2 shows. Model of hospital was one important source of variation, but between hospitals there is also evidence of considerable variation. In part, this is to be expected, given the differing roles of Model 4, Model 3, and Model 2 hospitals.

```{r Length of stay by hospital and hospital type, fig.cap= 'Length of stay (days) by hospital model and site (outliers excluded).', fig.dpi=1200, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}


ggplot(data=HIPE,
       aes(x=HospCode, y = rawlos, colour = ModelF)) +
           geom_boxplot(outliers = FALSE, varwidth = TRUE) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90)) +
    facet_wrap(~ModelF, scales = 'free') +
           labs( title = 'Length of stay in days by hospital model and site\n (outliers excluded)',
                 subtitle = 'HIPE data, aged 65 years or over, 3 or more days stay, acute hospitals only',
                 x = 'Hospital code',
                 y = 'Count') +
  guides(colour = "none", fill = "none", size = "none") +
  #guides(colour = guide_legend("Hospital\nModel"),
  #       fill = guide_legend("Hospital\nModel")) +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 12)

```

A table showing the median, and a range of quantiles for the length of stay is also helpful. This is presented in the same order as the items in Figure 2.

```{r LOS Table}

LOS <- HIPE %>%
    group_by(ModelF, HospCode) %>%
    summarise(Mean   = round(mean(rawlos, na.rm = TRUE),2),
              Q10    = quantile(rawlos, probs = 0.1),
              Q25    = quantile(rawlos, probs = 0.25),
              Median = quantile(rawlos, probs = 0.5),
              Q75    = quantile(rawlos, probs = 0.75),
              Q90    = quantile(rawlos, probs = 0.90)) %>%
    ungroup()

kbl(LOS,  booktabs = TRUE, longtable = TRUE,
    caption = "Length of Stay by Hospital Type and Site.")

rm(LOS)
```

Again there is substantial variation between and within hospital types.

## Deaths, and discharge outcomes

Another very important variable is deaths in hospital. While most patients are discharged alive (be that a return home, or a transfer to other care sites, including other acute hospitals), about 6% of those admitted, aged over 65, and staying for more than three days, did not survive.

The table gives the overall results, and the figure shows how this varied between hospitals, and hospital types

```{r Dead table}
Dead <- HIPE %>%
  group_by(Died) %>%
  summarise(N = n())

kbl(Dead,  booktabs = TRUE, longtable = FALSE,
    caption = "Discharged alive or dead.")

rm(Dead)
```


```{r Risk of death by hospital and hospital type Dots, fig.cap= 'Risk of death (per person) by hospital model and site.', fig.dpi=1200, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
Dead <- HIPE %>%
  select(ModelF, HospCode, Died) %>%
  group_by(ModelF, HospCode, Died) %>%
  summarise(N = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Died, values_from = N) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Dead = ifelse(is.na(Dead), 0, Dead)) %>%
  mutate(Admissions = Alive+Dead) %>%
  mutate(Risk = Dead/(Admissions))

ggplot(data=Dead,
       aes(x=HospCode, y = Risk, colour = ModelF)) +
           geom_point(aes(size = Admissions)) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 90)) +
    facet_wrap(~ModelF, scales = 'free_x') +
           labs( title = 'Risk of death by hospital model and site\n (point size is number of Admissions)',
                 subtitle = 'HIPE data, aged 65 years or over, 3 or more days stay, acute hospitals only',
                 x = 'Hospital code',
                 y = 'Risk of death') +
  guides(colour = "none", fill = "none", size = "none") +
    theme_minimal(base_size = 12)

rm(Dead)
```

It is important to emphasise that these crude death rates cannot be used to measure hospital outcomes, and still less to engage in the dubious activity of preparing league tables. Having said that, the results are not very surprising, and reflect the different roles and patient populations of the hospitals involved.

## Hospital coding

Different hospitals will provide different bundles of care. This is partly captured in the Hospital model. They may also have different coding practices. The coders receive common training, but the materials from they which they code may be more variable. To begin to address this, we start by examining the number of codes used in each hospital.

```{r Calculate code counts}
Coding_Summary <- HIPE %>%
  group_by(ModelF,HospCode) %>%
  summarise(across(c(age, ProcCount:HadxCount, ScoreEl, ScoreCh),
                   list(median = median, mean = mean, sd = sd)))
```

We show a series of hospital level variables.

### Age

Age at admission does not vary greatly between the main group of hospitals. Note that this particular work is confined to an older group of patients, all aged 65 or over, and admitted for at least three days.

```{r Draw age}
ggplot(data = HIPE,
       aes(x = HospCode, y = age, colour = ModelF)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_violin() +
  facet_wrap(~ModelF, scales='free_x') +
  labs (title='Age',
        x = 'Hospital',
        y = 'Age (years)')
```

### Elixhauser score

All hospitals have a wide range of Elixhauser scores, but Model 4 hospitals have more of the highest scores than the others. The commonest score is zero. Neither of these is unexpected.

```{r ScoreEl}
ggplot(data = HIPE,
       aes(x = HospCode, y = ScoreEl, colour = ModelF)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_violin() +
  facet_wrap(~ModelF, scales='free_x') +
  labs (title='Elixhauser score',
        x = 'Hospital',
        y = 'Elixhauser score')
```

### Counts of codes given

Each discharge record has up to three sets of codes - a code for up to thirty diagnoses, a code for up to twenty procedures, and a code for up to thirty health care acquired diagnoses.

For diagnoses, there is considerable variability in the number of codes given, which partly reflects case mix, and partly coding practices.

```{r Diagnosis codes count}
ggplot(data = HIPE,
       aes(x = HospCode, y = DxCount, colour = ModelF)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ModelF, scales='free_x') +
  labs (title='Number of diagnoses coded',
        x = 'Hospital',
        y = 'Number of Diagnoses coded')
```

A similar pattern can be seen for procedures, although there is some suggestions that practices in individual hospitals may be rather more different.

```{r Procedure codes count}
ggplot(data = HIPE,
       aes(x = HospCode, y = ProcCount, colour = ModelF)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_violin() +
  facet_wrap(~ModelF, scales='free_x') +
  labs (title='Number of procedures coded',
        x = 'Hospital',
        y = 'Number of Procedures coded')
```

For health care acquired diagnoses the median number of codes given is 0 in every hospital. The mean ranges from just over 0 to just over 2 depending on the hospitals, though there is substantial variability.

```{r HADx codes count}
ggplot(data = HIPE,
       aes(x = HospCode, y = HadxCount, colour = ModelF)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.05) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ModelF, scales='free_x') +
  labs (title='Number of health care acquired diagnoses coded',
        x = 'Hospital',
        y = 'Number of Health care Acquired Diagnoses coded')
```

# Checking of the Chart Review data and the HIPE site data

## Check dataset and check matching

First, we produce a summary of the chart review dataset. Please review this, and be sure that all of the variables are correct.

## Data summary with the skimr library

```{r Check data skimr, results = 'asis'}
skimr::skim(Cost2Care.HIPE)
```

Note that hadx.01 and hadx30 are both 100% missing. They are in the summary, but as logical variables.

## Check matching

It is desirable to check the matching, and see if the other HIPE.Site variables have the same values as those in the Cost2Care file.

There are two groups for comparison. 

## HIPE

In the first group the codes come from HIPE files, so the check is the correctness of the matching.

### UTI_hadx

```{r Check match tables UTI hadx code}

##################################################
# UTI
#
ctable(H.UTI_hadx <- as_factor(Cost2Care.HIPE$H.UTI_hadx),
  uti.hadx <- as_factor(Cost2Care.HIPE$uti.hadx),
  chisq = TRUE,
  prop = "n")

```

### DL_hadx

```{r Check match tables DL hadx code}
##################################################
# DL
#
ctable(H.DL_hadx <- as_factor(Cost2Care.HIPE$H.DL_hadx),
  delirium.hadx <- as_factor(Cost2Care.HIPE$delirium.hadx),
  chisq = TRUE,
  prop = "n")

```

### PU_hadx

```{r Check match tables PU hadx code}
##################################################
# PU
#
ctable(H.PU_hadx <- as_factor(Cost2Care.HIPE$H.PU_hadx),
  pressure.ulcer.hadx <- as_factor(Cost2Care.HIPE$pressure.ulcer.hadx),

### PN_hadx

```{r Check match tables PN hadx code}

  pneumonia.hadx <- as_factor(Cost2Care.HIPE$pneumonia.hadx),
  chisq = TRUE,
  prop = "n")

```

## F2M

```{r Check match tables any failure to Maintain (F2M)}
##################################################
# F2M
#
#Check
#names(Cost2Care.HIPE)[which(str_detect(names(Cost2Care.HIPE),"hadx"))]

  F2M <- as_factor(Cost2Care.HIPE$F2M),
  chisq = TRUE,
  prop = "n")

```

## Chart review vs. HIPE

In the second group, one code comes from the chart review, and the other from HIPE. This is the more substantively interesting

### Sex

```{r Check match tables Sex}
##################################################
# Sex

ctable(sex <- as_factor(
  Cost2Care.HIPE$sex),

### Age

```{r Check match tables Age}
##################################################
# Age
#
freq(Cost2Care.HIPE$Age_discharge - Cost2Care.HIPE$age) # Mostly ok, i.e. 0, but a few large discrepancies

```


```{r Pictures, fig.cap= 'Age recorded from the chart review, against Age recorded in the HIPE data, for the study hospital.', fig.dpi=1200, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
ggplot(data=Cost2Care.HIPE,
       aes(x = Age_discharge, y = age, colour=Gender)) + geom_jitter() # A bit clearer

```

### Elective or emergency admission

```{r Check match tables Elective or emergency admission}
##################################################
# elective or emergency admission
#

# Major outcomes

The main outcomes available are 

* the presence of a health care associated urinary tract infection (UTI - variable beginning with 'UTI.')
* the presence of health care associated pneumonia (PN - variable beginning with 'PN.')
* the presence of a health care associated pressure ulcer (PU - variable beginning with 'PU.')
* the presence of health care associated delirium infection (DL - variable beginning with 'DL.')
* Failure to maintian - i.e. any one or more of the above (F2M)
* Death recorded
* Prolonged length of stay

It is wholly possible to have several of these outcomes.

# Finalise analysis data

## Remove Maternity and Specialist hospitals

The HIPE dataset contains data from Model 4, Model 3 and Model 2 hospitals, as a well as the three large maternity hospitals in Dublin `r table(HIPE$ModelF)[[5]]` discharges, and five specialist hospitals, `r table(HIPE$ModelF)[[4]]` discharges. There is fair evidence, as shown above, that the latter two groups are rather different from the first three. There is also a case for removing the Model 2 hospitals, which account for  small proportion of total admissions, and serve rather different roles. Following discussion with the team, the `r table(HIPE$ModelF)[[3]]` Model 2 discharges were removed from the saved HIPE file. We also remove the corresponding factor levels from both the national HIPE file, and the chart review site file.

```{r Drop Model 2 specialist and maternity hospitals and corresponding factor levels}

HIPE <- HIPE %>%
    filter(ModelF %in% c('Model 4','Model 3')) %>%
    mutate(ModelF = fct_drop(ModelF)) %>%
      mutate(HospCode = fct_drop(HospCode))

HIPE.Site <- HIPE.Site %>%
    filter(ModelF %in% c('Model 4','Model 3')) %>% # Keep only Model 3 and Model 4 hospitals, in fact there is only one Model 4 hospital in the Site data.
    mutate(ModelF = fct_drop(ModelF)) %>% # Drop the unused factor levels
    mutate(HospCode = fct_drop(HospCode))

```

## Define sampling weights

The chart review was augmented to secure roughly equal number of medical and surgical admissions. This leads to a sizeable over-inclusion of surgical admissions in the data, relative to the totality of admissions.to account for this, we need to define a weighting variable.

The first table shows the proportion of medical and surgical patients in the chart review data, using two measures, the speciality of admission, and the use (or otherwise) of an anaesthetic.

```{r Chart review breakdown}
H.C <- HIPE.Site %>%
  mutate(AN = ifelse(Anaesthesia > 0, 'Yes', 'No')) %>%
  select(ModelF, HospCode, MedSurg, AN)
#table(H.C$MedSurg)
#table(H.C$AN)
ctable(H.C$MedSurg,H.C$AN, prop = 't')

```

The second is the corresponding table for all discharges in the chart review hospital.

```{r Study site breakdown}
H.S <- HIPE |>
  filter(HospCode == '4.1') %>%
    mutate(AN = ifelse(Anaesthesia > 0, 'Yes', 'No'))  %>%
  select(ModelF, HospCode, MedSurg, AN)

#table(H.S$MedSurg)
#table(H.S$AN)
ctable(H.S$MedSurg,H.S$AN, prop='t')

```

The third shows the same in all the model 3 and 4 hospitals.

```{r Model 3 and 4 breakdown}
H.A <- HIPE |>
  group_by(ModelF) %>%
    mutate(AN = ifelse(Anaesthesia > 0, 'Yes', 'No'))  %>%
  select(ModelF, HospCode, MedSurg, AN)

#table(H.A$MedSurg)
#table(H.A$AN)
ctable(H.A$MedSurg,H.A$AN, prop = 't')

```

Pulling these together, it's possible to calculate sampling weights, as inverse probability weights - these are the number of people in the population represented by each person in the chart review.

```{r Calculate the weights}
##############################################################
# Calculate the totals for each group
# 
H.C <- H.C |> # Study site Chart review cases
  group_by(ModelF, HospCode, MedSurg, AN) |>
  summarise(N.C = n())
H.S <- H.S |> # Study site total
  group_by(ModelF, HospCode, MedSurg, AN) |>
  summarise(N.S = n())
H.A <- H.A |> # All Model 3 and Model 4
  group_by(ModelF, HospCode, MedSurg, AN) |>
  summarise(N.A = n())

##############################################################
# Calculate weights to indicate how many discharges each
# sampled discharge represents
# 
Weights <- H.C |>
  full_join(H.S,by = join_by(ModelF, HospCode, MedSurg, AN))  |>
  mutate(Ratio = N.C/N.S) |>
  mutate(Weights = 1/Ratio) |>
  mutate(Check = N.C * Weights)

##############################################################
# Add the Weight variable to the Cost2Care.HIPE file
#
Cost2Care.HIPE <- Cost2Care.HIPE |>
  mutate(AN = ifelse(Anaesthesia > 0, 'Yes', 'No'))  |>
  right_join(Weights |> ungroup() |> select(MedSurg, AN, Weights),
             by = join_by(MedSurg, AN)) |>
  select(-AN)
```

```{r Weights table}
kable(Weights)
```

# Save files

```{r Save the files}
saveRDS(Cost2Care.HIPE, file = "data/Cost2Care.HIPE.Rds",
        ascii = FALSE, version = NULL,
        compress = TRUE, refhook = NULL)

saveRDS(HIPE, file = "data/HIPE.Rds",
        ascii = FALSE, version = NULL,
        compress = TRUE, refhook = NULL)

saveRDS(HIPE.Site, file = "data/HIPE.Site.Rds",
        ascii = FALSE, version = NULL,
        compress = TRUE, refhook = NULL)
